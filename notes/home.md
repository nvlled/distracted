# What and why

I've been working on a experimental project for the past 2-3 months, and everything is a mess, specifically, the code and my notes.

At least for the code, I have linters and compilers to help me easily clean up and organize. But my [[notes.txt]] has gotten too large that it has become hard to keep track what I'm writing. 

I decided to use a dedicated note taking tool (obsidian in this case) to try and tame the disorganized mess that I keep accumulating. Personally, I like to keep things plain and simple, which I tend to just use a plain unformatted text file when writing.

I will have to see if obsidian helps me organize my thoughts better, or becomes another distracting tool that keeps me from doing the more prioritized things.

I will keep the original [[notes.txt]] for reference, but I will copy and edit some sections to a separate file. For starters, I will continue with the [[relative-spacing]].
