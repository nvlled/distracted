hey, it's has already been 10 days since holloween.

What was I going to write? I was momentarily interrupted by a big ole lost bee. In my time hanging out in the open porch, I have been interrupted by three flying creatures at night: a large dragonfly, a crazy-ass little dingbat and now a bee. All three seems to be lost their way.

Anyways, I was going to say time flies better than a fruit fly on a banana, but that doesn't sound right. I mean that it seems like holloween was just yesterday. Where did all the days go?

I know, I've been working on this project. Surprise? By working, I mean coding and testing. Admittedly, there more unproductive days, but on the bright side I'm making progress. I guess?

At least, I'm very close to the project state that I had envisioned and revisioned many times. I am satisfied with the my testing for the past few days. It's actually working, I'm learning building up vocabulary with kanji, at least better than I did with anki.

But the question is, is it more efficient or effective than anki? Is the bent forgetting curve possible?

Putting aside the theory first, I think the app does overall provide me better experience with studying. Anki goes for the breadth-first, I go for the depth first. There are several advantages to depth-first studying:

- I would become proficient with a word fast. This means I can recognize them sooner in actual real-world scenarios. Contrast this with anki, where it might take a week or even months before I can practically apply it.
- I won't forget them sooner when I deal with more cards. When I grinded a card enough, it's hard to forget them within a week or two. Of course, it happens that I need to grind a particular card for several days, but that isn't a problem since I am simultaneously learning and reviewing other cards as well.
- I can create better associations with the new cards. Some cards a related or very similar. If I go through the breadth-first approach, I would have a difficult time noticing these relationships. Worse, it would confuse me and impair my learning.
- Depth-first is both applicable for short-term and long-term studying. I can use it to cram for the exam in the following day, or gradually use it to learn more difficult stuffs over a month.

Although there are downsides for sure. Just kidding, there are no downsides. Double kidding, there are downsides but I'm too biased right now to conceive a single one. Oh wait, I'm learning new cards everyday slower compared to anki. And I spend more than an hour studying per day?

Counting the new cards "learnt" everyday in anki is misleading. It's more accurate to say introduction than learn. It's counts as learned when you can recall it on random moments during a day, or can recognize it with confidence on the wild. Hard to do that on a single day after reviewing a card once or twice.

As for the time spent, it goes against the philosophy of the project to count the hours spent. This metric contributes very little to the actual outcome, aside from the fact that adds anxiety. Some would boast they only spend less than twenty minutes per day with anki. How do they achieve that with probably hundreds of cards to review? Probably sacrificing cognition for the sake of metrics. Just as I don't track hours while I'm procrastinating or just fooling around, I will not track my studying hours. And yes, procrastinating is an essential part of my mental health.

That said, I might estimate to do around 1-2 hours per day. That's trivial compared to the hours I spend procrastinating on HN/reddit/youtube. Or maybe half an hour. I don't know, and it doesn't matter. The important part is consistency without the anxiety. I don't' want to worry about breaking my studying streaks. If I ever managed to do a streak, it's through my own enthusiastic volition, and not out of guilt.
