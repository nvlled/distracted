There is another question that is bothering me.

Is my own experience, a sample size of N=1, a useful basis for exploring an idea or testing my own inquiries?

I've been casually skimming over papers, and one thing they have all in common is that they would have a selected sample of a population for testing their own theories or hypothesis, which is expected when the subject involves people.

But why can't they just test on one people? Wouldn't that be easier and faster? Wouldn't adding more people just create more confounding variables?

Because they are trying establish a scientific proposition, one that is generally or universally applicable to other people who may build upon that validated fact. An experience of one, my experience as lone idiot, may not generalize as a rule that explains something.

That said, it doesn't mean that my own experience has no bearing on this reality. What I experience and observe serves as a stepping stone for further inquiries. For initial experimentation, personal experience is acceptable, or dare I say, even imperative.

Why? Dedicated scientific ventures use resources, and because of that, scientists have to be selective of what research they do. They wouldn't venture into something without basis for it. Some questions, however curious they are, will be simply dismissed as something not delving into, or worse, something only a delusional moron would ask. 

Aha, I have gotten deeper into this larping as a scientist. To save me self from being declared a scientifically-proven delusional larpist, it would best serve me to avoid using the word science from here on. Alternatively, I could coin or reuse a less serious term.
