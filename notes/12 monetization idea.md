I mentioned in [[word search]] about adding back the distraction as a quick, sub-minute distraction. What if, in addition to user-added images, I squeeze some ads?

Good idea?  Probably not, because ads implies tracking and privacy violations (for embedded, script ads at least). But what about simple sponsored content? Yeah no, it's too early to be thinking of that, but it's an idea if ever the project has gotten that point.

Wait, what if only put the sponsored content on the free version? And create a paid-version that is untainted with adware? I've seen some opensource projects do that, I think?
