I found a yet another blog/note-taking site on HN, called [nicheless](https://nicheless.blog). On the final hour of the halloween, I wrote the following as a test content:

> Happy holloween, a day to entertain our hearts with exciting fright and terror. Humans are weird. I think I mispelled a word or two, probably more as I go write along, but hey, who says I can't be dumb on a spooky day.  
> I habitually nervously scratch my nose as I gather and piece together my scattered thoughts. Do I even have anything particular to write?  
>   
> No, not really. Something's bothering me, and I subconsciously reach for a blank slate to pen my train of thought. It's an hour more before this day of holloweening ends. I know now, why this day felt like an unusual disappointment: a supposedly festive day is about to end, and I did nothing about it. I let a day waste away, just like every other day. I could have done something fun or different for a change. Watch something scary, play a scary game. But no, I'm trapped in this pseudo-endless cycle of mundane routine of living for another day. I wanted trick or treats, even figuratively, but all I get is the unwelcoming horrors of boring reality.  
>   
> The reality that there are no ghosts, monsters, zombies, aliens, or any inter-dimensional creatures that exists parallel to this stupid plane of utter insipidity.  
>   
> Thanks science, thanks for erecting these walls that demarcate what is real and what is possible. Systems and abstractions have been established, any future thoughts and imagination mankind will be restricted within this walls we imposed upon ourselves, for better or worse. Are we nearing the peak of attainable knowledge? Or did we trapped ourselves onto a dead-end?  
>   
> Yeah, right. Fuck you science and your authoritarian ways that dictate how I think. I'll believe in ghosts, aliens, psychics and time travellers however I want. I may have forgotten about brevity, but o-

I was being semi-random, but it ultimately devolved into a spiteful diatribe on science. Of course, I perfectly love science, the science that resulted to everything related to weeb content, the science that vastly improved the quality of modern life. Still, it's something of a double-edge sword. I need not go into details what it costed humanity to get into what we are now.

What I'm particularly sore about is how science has become somewhat of an authority to humanity's knowledge and wisdom. It made people of today incapable of thought that is not approved by science. It created epistemological zombies who lacks function to derive any kind of source of truth through their own reasoning. These zombies always defer the truth to authority.

Even the clergies of science, the scientists and the scientismists, has been infected. Scientists would be stereotypically atheists, and non-believers of anything not found in the bible of science. It takes an exceptional conceit to believe we have everything figured out, and shun any thoughts that seem to contradict the artificial reality as defined by current science. 

What is my point? Am I saying there are indeed ghosts and mythical creatures roaming about? No (well not necessarily), I'm objecting to the idea that there's all to it, this is reality, we figured out how physics work, how the world works. This is the kind of mindset that will hold us back, and will ultimately breed people with no imagination and naitivety. 

I am somewhat parroting what Freyebrand is saying. Heck, maybe it's even the ghost of Feyerabend that possessed me to utter these gibberish. Oh no, I said ghost, look at all the intellectual scientists losing their mind over my irrational belief in non-existent bullshit. Blah, blah, blah, keel over my 4-dimensional dong, mofos.

Writing about epistemology, science and philosophy is actually pretty fun, especially on something I know nothing about. Sure, I hold zero credentials on these fields, who's going to stop me from crapping on these unchartered territory.
