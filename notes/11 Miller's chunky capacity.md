The notes here are only applicable when the current scheduling proves to be inadequate.

quick brain dump
- limit "active learning cards" (ALC) to N, where N might be 7Â±2, or any arbitrary number, since it was actually shown that this limit differs for each person
- how would I define chunks in this case, will "cards" be good enough? card chunks do help me avoid writing more code
- the purpose of this is to help avoid premature fatigue, or be cognitively overloaded, as well as ease out of the short-term memory
- is short-term and working memory an important and actual distinction in practice?
- once a card surpasses short-term memory, it can be taken out of ALC, where another card can be added
- how would it know if I  surpassed short-term memory? proficiency crosses a certain threshold
- these are just specific implementation details of the current scheduler, it does not affect anything else
- for each batch, most of the cards in the ALC should be presented, with some other cards not in ALC included
