For testing purposes, I should only use words that have at most 2-3 kanji in it.

Here are my notes when I'm actually commiting to learning japanese (with the focus on being able to read and listen):
- focus on learning most common words first AND
- focus on words that have the kanjis included in [https://github.com/scriptin/topokanji](TopoKanji)

- sorts these words alphabetically, so that similar looking kanjis are done together
- TopoKanji and radicals are related, but I believe TopoKanji has a more practical and real-use ordering
- always learn a word with an example sentence with sounds (use TTS is needed, better than nothing), the learning the vocabulary is prioritized over grammar and proper usage
- find a graded reader texts, like tadoku, then grind and proficiently learn all the words in that text before reading it
- this approach is better IMO because ...
