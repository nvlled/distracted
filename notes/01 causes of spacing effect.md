While I'm stuck deciding what to name my [[interfaces|components]], I did a bit more reading on the spacing effect from wikipedia, particularly on the causes of spacing effect.

[[relative-spacing|Previously]], I guessed that spacing effect is caused by repeated cycles of forgetting and recalling. I didn't entirely come up with that on my own, I read it from another source, but I forgot where (ha-ha?). Since it matches my own experience, I largely agree with this idea and it seems like a straightforward explanation.

But then again, looking at causes section of wikipedia, there appears to be a lot of theories for the spacing effect, none of which seems to be straightforward. So I guess there's a lot more variable to account for.

I will list the causes here and briefly discuss why I do or don't agree with it. Not that I am qualified to do so. 

### Semantic priming
This one relies on a psychological concept of priming, where exposure to a stimulus influences subsequent stimulus of the same kind. I'm guessing *stimulus* here has a psychology specific definition, but in very, very general terms, stimulus refers to the reaction of an event. For instance, I see a particular funny meme. The first time, I go lemaoing all over it. But if I keep viewing it two or three times in a row in a brief span of time, I will quickly get tired of it.

Anyway, it seems like an interesting and intuitive idea, but the catch is that it suffers from replication crisis, so I will promptly nope out of it. I have enough problems replicating my own genes through my theoretical descendants (ha-ha?).

But okay, suppose that priming has solid, replicable foundations. How does that relate to spacing effect? How would having a strong(er) reaction to results to better retention? Okay, people tend to not forget their happiest or shittiest memorable moments of their life. But is that really applicable to more mundane scenarios such as trying to remember what feet is in japanese? Or is the stimulus significant enough to matter? Would it even scale? Must I have a significant reaction to all the thousand words I need to remember them better?

The answer: maybe, or maybe not. If my personal opinion matters and if I may use my naivety as a supporting argument, I think semantic priming is quite unlikely as a cause of the spacing effect.

### Encoding variability
This one is interesting, it indirectly supports what I'm doing since it posits that the spacing effect is entirely dependent on the context, and that time is not a significant factor in the effect. Meaning, it doesn't matter if I cram, as long as the retrieval cues are sufficiently varied.
Unfortunately, the cited (dated) research showed evidence against this idea. But, regardless of any supporting non-conclusive evidence, I largely disagree with this theory anyway. My gut-feeling reason is that the explanation is either too technical, or badly written, or I'm simply dumb. More seriously, uh, this is hard to explain, I'll come back to this later.

One important thing to note is that some of these theories are made in contrast to mass presentation (i.e. cramming). What I'm doing is something in-between, or a mixture of spaced and mass repetition, so these studies would either support or refute my work, depending on how I interpret them. For the most part, I'm just assimilating ideas from these studies anyway, despite of their epistemological significance. Why? Because in the end, no one is still sure what is the truth, if spacing effect absolutely holds, and if does, on what conditions. Just as some researchers use their own tools and methods to explore the problem, I too would utilize my own, albeit less rigorous and more practical and hands-on approach. 

It's perfectly legal to do science for cultivating my own personal epistemological landscape. Am I using that word correctly though? Or spell it correctly? E-espietemelo.. Anyway, I don't dream of making a dent on Science.

## Other considerations
My contention as usual is on the assertion (or unchallenged assumption?) that time is an essential component of spacing effect. In the paper I [[relative-spacing|discussed previously]], it indicated that varying scheduling interval has no measurable impact on long-term retention (in comparison to fixed scheduling interval), which is one of the core ideas that spacing effect bases on, the other which is that any spacing significant interval will trigger the effect. My guess is that time is not a significant factor on spacing effect, and that the effect is triggered on the present state of the mind (to put in a very wishy-washy way).

I could go on and spend ridiculous amount of time burrowing on the depths of the spaced rabbit holes, but there's something I should keep in mind. Much of the literature on spaced repetition (the ones I see on wikipedia anyway) came from psychology. I don't mean to look down on psychology, but from what I see, it's rife with replication crisis. It's probably not a problem with the researchers, but a problem with the difficulty of mapping out the complexity of the human mind. As I said numerous times already, the literature only serves as a guide to the personal truth that I seek. Maybe the answer, on the unlikely chance that I did managed to uncover something, cannot be generalized to a scientific fact. Even then, I would at least be satisfied. 

These ramblings may feel like I'm rationalizing, maybe I am, but I do need to reinforce my own motivations and goals from time to time. I also notice some weakness in my own arguments, though it is more of an attribute of my inability to thoroughly explain myself, which in doing so may not be worth the effort. At least, not at the time being.
