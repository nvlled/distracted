I think I could make an entirely separate app, dedicated solely for learning individual kanjis by means of creatively coloring them. The users could then share their each own shitty work to each other.

This is of course still complementary to the current project I'm working on. I should stop getting distracted and finish it to a usable state.

I mean, why limit it to kanji? Any supported unicode character will do.

For now, just finish the ColorText component, and test it if it improves retention.
