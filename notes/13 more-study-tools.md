There recently two interesting HN submissions that are relavant for this project:
- save all
- quazel.com

**quazel** is for conversational language study using AI. It would definitely be a useful tool for practicing output, but it's too early for me try it seriously (yet?).

**save all** initially looks like it's an alternative anki tool for general purpose studying, but after some brief use, it's clear that it's more akin to a generalized duolingo, for all-purpose stuying. I reserve any judgments for now with regards to how effective it is.
I do feel like it overpromises when it comes to marketing it's benefits, but I do see where the project owners are coming from.

I plan to use it in earnest, out of interest, and also as a potential source of ideas. I do prefer the simplicity of anki though,
without all the gamified fluffs designed to engage users.

One lesson to take away  from the HN thread is that the creator does not hold back at promoting it. I wish I have that assertiveness and confidence to put things out there.
