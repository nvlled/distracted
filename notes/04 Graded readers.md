I found some nifty resources for jp immersion. This note section is out of scope for this project, thus will not be implemented as features here, but it could be a later sibling project that would complement this program.

As of now, I'm solving the problem of memorizing large volumes of disjuncted information, e.g. vocabulary.

The next problem to solve would be literacy or fluency. I'm deriving the previous idea of pasting a text and then selecting the cards that matches the "words" in  the text. I will build on that idea.

This is where tadoku.org comes in. The provided graded books that designed to be accesible for all levels of  readers by using furigana. It's a nice idea, but I noticed one major flaw: I doubt you can learn kanji by always showing the furigana. For me,  I would focus mostly on the furigana, and hardly on the kanji itself. The baffling part is that they used images or pdfs, instead of html documents. It's books like these that could benefit from even a little interactivity. Wait, is this a general criticism of furigana? Maybe, I guess there's a reason why japanese discourage their use?

The other problem is that you still need a base level vocabulary and grammar to read this. Otherwise it mostly  incomprehensible input. Can't just I just infer the meaning based on word usage? Okay, I read hiroshima. Assuming I didn't know that hiroshima is a name of a place, there's no way I could infer that. In short, level 0 is a nice way to get readers to start, but still misleading.

No, but their advice is to just read what you can understand. Their actual wording is to just enjoy reading without translating, or using a dictionary, and that the kanji will look familiar eventually.

Nope, I like their base idea, but their marketing phrase is just plain misleading, and the execution fell short. Am I not being too uncharitable? Objectively speaking, no, even level 0 requires at least some little previous japanese knowledge.

There are two ways around this: I convert some books in simple interactive documents, where the reader could toggle between different scripts. It's written in manga style though? Just photoshop the pictures to remove the embedded text, just enough as proof of concept.  Then I test it if it improves usability (for me).

The other solution is extract each word from a book, then create a deck out of it. I grind the heck out of it, until I'm comfortable with each word. Then I go back to the book, actually read the goddamn thing. 

Where's the solution? People do that already. There's one tiny difference. One approach is to study the most common words first.
Then start immersing, hoping to encounter those words.

In this case though, I study and master all the words (and maybe grammar) first from a text (preferrably short texts like tadoku books)
before reading it, then read that text with almost guaranteed 100% comprehensible input. The difference is shortened feedback cycle from  studying vocab to learning/application.

Of course, this study flow is especially supported  with this app I'm working on. And all these I'm working on aren't specific to japanese learning too.

I don't know, this is a half-formed idea anyway. I will come back to this later on.
